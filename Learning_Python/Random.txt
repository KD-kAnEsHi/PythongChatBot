How to round numbers in python:
    strs(round( piNumber, i))       # Round the decimal by the value i


Combine sublists in python:
    list(zip(matrix))               # function is used to combine multiple iterables (such as lists, 
                                    tuples, or strings) into an iterator of tuples

        Example: 
            a = [1, 2, 3]
            b = ['a', 'b', 'c']
            result = zip(a, b)
            print(list(result))  # Output: [(1, 'a'), (2, 'b'), (3, 'c')]


Different between lists and tuples:
    - Tuples are immutable, and usually contain a heterogeneous sequence of elements that are accessed via unpacking 
    while or or indexing 
    - Lists are mutable, and their elements are usually homogeneous and are accessed by iterating over the list.
