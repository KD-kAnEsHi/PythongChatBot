            The You Laugh, You Drink card game is a party game designed for people who struggle to 
            keep a straight face. It includes 150 cards with hilarious prompts that players use to
            make others laugh. On their turn, a player picks a card, silently reads it, and has 30 
            seconds to make a chosen "target" in the group laugh by performing the action or scenario
            described on the card. The player must not hold back, while the target tries to maintain
            a straight face. If the target laughs, they lose and must take a "sip of shame," although
            the game can be played with or without beverages.
